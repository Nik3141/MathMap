# MathMap
A detailed map of all of mathematics up to graduate school, complete with *intuitive* explanations for each concept and skill. The plan is to be done by Jan 1, 2025.

# Structure
Most concepts in math can be connected to set theory, and thus can be connected to each other. So by viewing mathematics through the lens of set theory, we can gain a more centralized, organized, and cohesive understanding of mathematics. Hence the goal of this math map is to use naive set theory as a scaffolding to build all of K-12 mathematics around, and then branch out into axiomatic set theory after calculus, but before the other subjects that come after that (analysis, topology, etc).

# Implementation
Right now, most of the work is being done in the shower, while lying awake in bed at 3am unable to fall asleep, and during breaks in between class periods. That is to say, most of the work is just figuring out how different math topics connect to each other and deciding how best to present them. For this, there's a lot of paper drafting involved. *Once this is done, however*: we are using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a Markdown viewer, to create the map and visualize it. If you want to view the map, you'll need to download Obsidian, then use it to view the contents of this repository once you've cloned the repository to your hard drive.

# Intended Use
This map of mathematics is intended for use by three groups: students, parents, and teachers. The beginning topics (basic arithmetic and pure geometry), generally taught to students between the ages of 5 and 10, are intended to be viewed by parents and teachers and then taught to students verbally, with visual aids. For the early intermediate topics (basic algebra and coordinate geometry), which are intended for students ages 10 to 14, sufficiently advanced students should be able to read the explanations for each concept on their own, but adult supervision, assistance, and discussion is recommended. The late intermediate topics (precalculus-level algebra and geometry) should be accessible to students ages 14 to 18 independent of adult assistance (although of course adult encouragement and discussion is always recommended). For topics beyond this, we don't really know what we're doing and recommend that you try your best and hopefully you get it. Seriously. We have no clue what we're doing. Send help.

# Future Plans
Although right now the goal is just to create the map of topics, in the future we want to create a free and easy to access webpage and an easily shareable client-side desktop app.
