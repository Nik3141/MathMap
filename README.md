# MathMap

## Vision Statement

The goal of this project is to create a self-contained resource which allows anybody, **regardless of prior mathematical knowledge, ability, or maturity**, to learn any mathematical topic they want. This resource will take the form of a detailed "map" of all of K-12 and undergraduate mathematics, along with some graduate-level mathematics.

This map will consist of "notes" arranged into "sequences"; each sequence aims to be a self-contained explanation of a topic, and each note aims to be an intuitive explanation of a single concept/skill.

A major problem we see with many school math curriculums today is that they feel "all over the place". Our goal is that **all of K-12 mathematics will be structured around arithmetic, naive set theory and basic zeroth- and first-order logic**. Most concepts in math can be connected to set theory, and thus can be connected to each other, so by viewing mathematics through the lens of set theory, we hope students will see math as a more cohesive and organized whole.

**We are not attempting to create a map of rigorous mathematical dependencies**: this is intended to be an educational tool and considers students' age (and hence ability to think abstractly) in ordering topics. It will likely introduce topics using imprecise analogies (that will be clarified later on) and revisit topics in increasing levels of depth, rigor, and/or abstraction.

A mathematician named Paul Lockhart wrote an excellent essay called [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf), which I strongly suggest you check out. I will summarize some of his main points here, adding in a few of my own ideas:

If we're being honest, math education in schools today is somewhat disastrous. Math is presented as a subject which must be learned, even if it's not fun, because it's a practical tool which is necessary out "there" in "the real world". This is ridiculous on its face, as any quick observation of the average adult will reveal that they use a calculator for arithmetic and essentially never encounter any math beyond that, other than perhaps statistics if they're into sports. **We're kidding ourselves if we say that math is *necessary* out in the real world**; it's useful for being able to understand things such as computer science or physics or just random DIY projects, but the majority of adults don't use it.

Painting or music might not be strictly "useful" in the sense that they don't directly produce any physical utility for the average person, but they make life a little more interesting and give people something fun to do in their spare time. There's no reason that math should be any different: math should be a fun hobby people can choose to do in their spare time because it enriches their lives and maybe makes the world a little more beautiful. And math has the added bonus that it can be *extremely* useful, so not only do we give people a fun hobby but we also end up educating our population, which will help us advance faster as a species overall.

**Hence, we don't want to recreate any already-existing school mathematics curriculum**: we are attempting to make something new that allows people to learn math more efficiently and understand it at a deeper level. So although this curriculum won't match up perfectly with the ones commonly used in schools, it will hopefully give students more of an opportunity to view math as a fun subject to explore, rather than a set of skills they're supposed to use out in the "real world".

This project was actually inspired by math articles on Wikipedia. Specifically, it was inspired by how difficult it was to learn math from them. Wikipedia pages are almost impossible to learn math from because rather than explaining it like you would when teaching, they just present the information cold. To understand a Wikipedia article, you essentially already need to know the subject being presented.

And that's not even to mention the plethora of inline links and labyrinthine circular dependencies which make simply *reading* the article frustrating: it's never fun to visit a Wikipedia page with 20 links in the first sentence, and visiting some of those links takes you to other pages which link back to the page you started at.

So although we're using Obsidian for this project, the goal is not to create a web of ideas as is normal in Obsidian. **We don't want to recreate Wikipedia.** Instead, we want to create a relatively linear progression of ideas which is easy to follow (we don't want one note to link to 30 other vaguely related notes) and which explains concepts in a way which makes it really easy to learn (without assuming any prior knowledge).

From a practical standpoint, this means that **each "sequence" of notes should be as self-contained as possible**, and the order which the notes within the sequence are laid out should be carefully considered. Each note should link to a few - maybe one, maybe two, maybe three - closely related notes which would be logical to learn next, while most connections are between sequence introductions and conclusions. And perhaps most importantly, there should be nothing simply implied or left unsaid: everything should be explicitly stated and clearly and intuitively explained.

The goal is that the math map presents a well-curated progression of topics from the very beginnings of mathematics all the way to its extremities. A person with no math knowledge should be able to read through it, understanding everything. That way it can be used by teachers in school classrooms, homeschooling parents in their living rooms, and self-learning students in their basements; it can be useful to anyone, regardless of where they are in their math education.

Our plan is to have completed all of K-12 and undergraduate mathematics by Jan 1, 2025. You can check out the road map for more information.

## Viewing the Map

We are using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a Markdown viewer, to create the map and visualize it. If you want to view the map, you'll need to download Obsidian, then download the "Math Map Vault" folder to your hard drive. Then, open Obsidian and select "Open Folder as Vault". Then select the "Math Map Vault" folder. You can now view the math map.

## Intended Use

This map of mathematics is intended for use by three groups: students, guardians, and teachers. We try to make the overall layout as well as the explanations as simple and intuitive as possible; that being said, some students, particularly younger ones, will probably benefit the most from having a guardian or teacher explain the concepts to them.

Specific instructions for how you can contribute are located in the vault itself.

## Contact and Contribution

If you're interested in contributing to the project or have any questions, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dvW2HzBCMG). 

The biggest contribution you can make is spreading the word about the project. If you want to contribute but don't want to use GitHub, you can view the map as described in the section above, and message me in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dvW2HzBCMG) with any suggestions. If you want to contribute directly to the project, [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this GitHub repository to your account, then clone it to your hard drive. If you have the GitHub Desktop client, you'll most likely find the vault file (called "Math Map Vault") in your "GitHub" folder. Then, open [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (after downloading it) and select "Open Folder as Vault". Then select the "Math Map Vault" folder from earlier. Now you can make edits and, using your GitHub desktop client, push them to the main branch of the project for review. 

## Future Plans

We are planning on using Obsidian Publish to put the map out on the internet as soon as we have an acceptable minimum of content. If at some point we are able to create our own website which is tailored to our more specific custom needs, we'll do that, but for now the focus is on aggregating and then spreading knowledge about mathematics.
