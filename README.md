# MathMap
A detailed map of all of mathematics up to (and potentially through) graduate school mathematics, complete with intuitive explanations for each concept and skill. We are essentially trying to mimic tech trees from videogames, but with mathematics. The plan is to have made significant progress (all of K-12 and undergraduate mathematics) by Jan 1, 2025.

# Structure
Most concepts in math can be connected to set theory, and thus can be connected to each other. So by viewing mathematics through the lens of set theory, we can gain a more centralized, organized, and cohesive understanding of mathematics. Hence the goal of this math map is to use naive set theory as a scaffolding to build all of K-12 mathematics around, and then branch out into axiomatic set theory and other more advanced mathematics topics.

# Viewing the Map
We are using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a Markdown viewer, to create the map and visualize it. If you want to view the map, you'll need to download Obsidian, then download the "Math Map Vault" file to your hard drive. Then, open Obsidian and select "Open Folder as Vault". Then select the "Math Map Vault" folder. You can now view the math map.

# Intended Use
This map of mathematics is intended for use by three groups: students, guardians, and teachers. We try to make the explanations as simple as possible and the notes (what we call each 'topic', being either a concept, skill, or other useful piece of knowledge) as atomized as possible. That being said, some students, particularly younger ones, will probably benefit the most from having a guardian or teacher explain the subject to them.

# Contribution
First off, the biggest contribution you can make is spreading the word about the project. If you want to contribute but don't want to use GitHub, you can view the map as described in the section above, and DM me in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dvW2HzBCMG) with any suggestions. If you want to contribute directly to the project, clone this GitHub repository to your hard drive. If you have the GitHub Desktop client, you'll most likely find the vault file (called "Math Map Vault") in your "GitHub" folder. Then, open [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (after downloading it) and select "Open Folder as Vault". Then select the "Math Map Vault" folder from earlier. Now you can make edits, and using your GitHub desktop client push them to the main branch of the project for review.

Some ways you can contribute:
- Write a segment about a mathematical topic which hasn't been covered yet.
- Edit a segment to make it clearer, more accurate, more accessible/less wordy, or better in general.
- Reorganize some section to make sure that each concept flows from the previous in a natural way, and that the title of each note is as accurate and simple as possible.
- Reorganize the tags or other metadata structures.
- Spread the word about the project.

# Future Plans
We are planning on using Obsidian Publish to put the map out on the internet as soon as we have an acceptable minimum of content. If at some point we are able to create our own website which is tailored to our more specific custom needs, we'll do that, but for now the focus is on aggregating and then spreading knowledge about mathematics.
