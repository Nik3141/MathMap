# MathMap
A detailed map of all of mathematics up to (and potentially through) graduate school mathematics, complete with intuitive explanations for each concept and skill. The plan is to have made significant progress (all of K-12 and undergraduate mathematics) by Jan 1, 2025.

# Structure
Most concepts in math can be connected to set theory, and thus can be connected to each other. So by viewing mathematics through the lens of set theory, we can gain a more centralized, organized, and cohesive understanding of mathematics. Hence the goal of this math map is to use naive set theory as a scaffolding to build all of K-12 mathematics around, and then branch out into axiomatic set theory and other more advanced mathematics topics.

# Implementation
We are using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a Markdown viewer, to create the map and visualize it. If you want to view the map, you'll need to download Obsidian, then use it to view the contents of this repository once you've cloned the repository to your hard drive. We are planning on using Obsidian Publish to put it out on the internet as soon as we have an acceptable minimum of content. If at some point we are able to create our own website which is tailored to our more specific custom needs, we'll do that, but for now the focus is on aggregating and then spreading knowledge about mathematics.

# Intended Use
This map of mathematics is intended for use by three groups: students, guardians, and teachers. We try to make the explanations as simple as possible and the notes (what we call each 'topic', being either a concept, skill, or other useful piece of knowledge) as atomized as possible. That being said, some students, particularly younger ones, will probably benefit the most from having a guardian or teacher explain the subject to them.
