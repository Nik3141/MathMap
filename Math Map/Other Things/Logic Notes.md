USE LOTS OF EXAMPLES

Natural/Whole/etc "Special Sets"

$$N /subseteq W /subseteq Z /subseteq Q /subseteq R /subseteq C$$

Von Neumann construction of the natural numbers:
assign a set to represent a number

0 = { } = null set/empty set
n + 1 = n U {n}

0 = {}
1 = { 0 } = 0 U {0} = {} U { {} } = {{}}
2 = { 0, 1 } = 1 U {1} = {{}} U { {{}} } = { {}, {{}} }
3 = {0, 1, 2} = 2 U {2} = { {}, {{}} } U { { {}, {{}} } } = { {}, {{}}, { {}, {{}} } }
4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} = { {}, {{}}, { {}, {{}} }, { {}, {{}}, { {}, {{}} } }}
