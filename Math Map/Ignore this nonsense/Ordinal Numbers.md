[[Representing Single-Digit Numbers Symbolically]]

Once students begin to count verbally, they can begin to use numbers to order items in lists. This is using numbers in the context of **ordinality**. The student's mentor figures should encourage them to count their way through lists of things: people standing in line, racecars finishing races, pages in books, etc.

Students should also come to understand how sometimes the [[Nominal Numbers]] assigned to a set of items correspond with their ordinals: page 5 is often the fifth page in the book. However, this isn't a requirement: racecar 99 can finish in first place.

It is important that the student has both a firm grasp on representing the placement of items in lists with numbers and representing numbers with the placement of items in a list. For example, the student should be able to determine what place in line some person is, but should also be able to put themselves in 9th place to represent the number 9.
