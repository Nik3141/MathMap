[[Representing Single-Digit Numbers Symbolically]]

Once students begin to count verbally, they can begin to use numbers to count items. This is using numbers in the context of **cardinality**. The student's mentor figures should encourage them to count as many things as are available as often as possible: people, beans, trees, books, vegetables, etc.

It is important that the student has both a firm grasp on representing groups of items with numbers and representing numbers with groups of items. For example, the student should be able to count that there are 7 marbles on a table, but should also be able to create a group of 7 marbles on a table to represent the number 7.
