# Elements and Membership 1
Sets on their own are great, but it's better if we can put something in them. **Elements** (sometimes called **members**) are the objects we put inside sets, and the relationship between elements and sets is called the **membership relation**.

The convention is that while sets are labeled with uppercase English letters, elements are labeled with lowercase English letters. Let's say that we have some object which we'll call $x$. Let's also suppose that we have an empty set which we'll call $S$. If we want $x$ to be an element of $S$, we can use the symbol for membership, which looks like this: $\in$

$\in$ means "in", so to show that $x$ is an element of $S$ we can write $$x \in S$$

This means "x is in S". It could also be read as:

- "x is an element of S"
- "x is a member of S"

In our shoebox analogy, pretend that $x$ is some object - maybe it's a book, maybe a LEGO piece, or maybe it's actually a shoe...it doesn't really matter - and you put it in the shoebox labeled 'S'.

Another way that we can write this using our curly braces notation is like so: $$S = \{x\}$$

This would be read as "S contains x".

Note that any set with exactly one object - no more, no less - is sometimes called a **singleton**.
