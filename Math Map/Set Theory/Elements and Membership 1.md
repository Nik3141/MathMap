# Elements and Membership 1
**Elements** (sometimes called **members**) are the objects we put inside sets, and the relationship between elements and sets is called the **membership relation**.

The convention is that while sets are labeled with uppercase English letters, elements are labeled with lowercase English letters. Let's say that we have some object which we'll call $x$. If we want $x$ to be an element of some set $S$, we can use the symbol for membership, which looks like this: $\in$

$\in$ means "in", so to show that $x$ is an element of $S$ we can write $$x \in S$$

This means "x is in S". It could also be read as:

- "x is an element of S"
- "x is a member of S"

In our box analogy, pretend that $x$ is some object - maybe it's a book, a LEGO piece, a twig...it doesn't really matter - and you put it in the box labeled 'S'.

Let's use an example from earlier: days in the week. If the set $D$ is the collection of all of the days in the week, then 'Monday' is an element of $D$: $Monday \in D$
