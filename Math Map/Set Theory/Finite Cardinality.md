# Finite Cardinality
Now that we understand that sets are objects which contain elements or, equivalently, elements are objects which are members of sets, we can start to investigate the properties of sets. **Cardinality** refers to the number of items which a set contains.

For example, the set $$A = \{x, y, z\}$$ has a cardinality of three. The set $$B = \{u, v\}$$ has a cardinality of two. The empty set $\emptyset$ has a cardinality of zero.
