# Limitations of the Physical Analogy
Our shoebox analogy has us picture sets as labeled containers where we can put all manner of objects (as long as we don't put any repeat elements). It's a useful analogy because it gives students a non-abstract way to conceptualize sets, elements, and membership. However, it has some limitations which we should be aware of.

First of all, the very nature of the phrase "put in" implies that a physical action has occurred and time has passed; this is not accurate. In set theory, we *define* a set to have certain elements, and it instantaneously pops into existence as soon as we do so. For example, the statement $$M = \{p, q\}$$

says that $M$ has two elements, $p$ and $q$. It might be tempting to think of us starting with an empty set, then adding $p$, then adding $q$. But in reality, the set appeared as is as soon as we thought of it. Furthermore, say that we decided to write another statement, saying that $$M = \{p\}$$

It would certainly be convenient to say that we "removed" $q$, but this type of physically-oriented thinking isn't quite accurate. It's more accurate to say that we "redefined" $M$ to only contain one element: $p$.

Another related issue with our physical shoebox analogy is that the concept of "putting in" implies an order. However, as we mentioned before, sets are completely unordered. There is no "first" or "second" or "third" element in a set: every element is jumbled together. The statements $S = \{a, b\}$ and $S = \{b, a\}$ are identical from a set theory perspective.
