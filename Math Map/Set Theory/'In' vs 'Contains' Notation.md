# 'In' vs 'Contains' Notation
You might see the symbol $\ni$ sometimes. It's the inverse of the $\in$ symbol. Whereas $\in$ means "in", $\ni$ means "contains".

This symbol is simply a different way to express the membership relation, where the set which contains the elements is written before the actual elements. So as an example, $$Z \ni m$$

means the same thing as $$m \in Z$$

They both say the same thing, but they each say it in different ways. The first one says "Z contains m" while the second one says "m is in Z".

Standard (preferred) notation is that you use $\in$, not $\ni$.
