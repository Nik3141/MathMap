# Empty Sets
The most basic object of set theory is, as the name suggests, the **set**. A set can be conceptualized as any container - a shoebox, a tabletop, a refrigerator, really anything you like. I like the shoebox analogy the most, so that's what I'll be using from now on.

Because we might be dealing with many different sets, we'll want to label each one so we can tell them apart. The convention is to use uppercase English letters to represent sets. Let's say that our first set is called $S$. For now, $S$ is empty, and we could show this by writing: $$S = \{\}$$

The curly braces are where we'd write the contents of the set; right now, there's nothing inside them, so the set is empty.

The set with no elements inside is a very special set: it's the **empty set** (also known as the **null set**), which we symbolize with zero with a slash through it: $\emptyset$.

Our set $S$ (which we maybe conceptualize as a shoebox on which we've written the letter 'S' using a marker) has no elements inside it. So does the empty set. Sets are considered equal when they have the exact same elements (we'll go into this more later down the line). Because both $S$ and the empty set have no elements, they have the same elements, so they're equal: $$S = \{\} = \emptyset$$

Since there can only ever be exactly one empty set, some people just say that $S$ *is* the empty set, rather than saying $S$ is *equal to* the empty set. Either way is fine.
