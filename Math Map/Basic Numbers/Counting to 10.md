The first step in mathematics is when the student begins counting to 10. At this point, they likely can't even read, but they will observe their mentor figures counting and will try to replicate it.

There are three main contexts numbers are used in:
- as [[Cardinal Numbers]] (counting items in a group)
- as [[Ordinal Numbers]] (ordering items in a list)
- as [[Nominal Numbers]] (naming items, like a racecar number)
