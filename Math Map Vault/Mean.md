Now, image you shake the box so that all the sand is level. This new height that all the sand is it, is the **average height**.

The formula for the average of a list of values $\{x_1,~x_2,~x_3,~\cdots,~x_n\}$ is equal to the sum of all the values in the list, divided by the number of items in that list. We refer to this average value with the Greek letter "mu" $\mu$, pronounced "mew".

$$\mu~=~\frac{x_1~+~x_2~+~x_3~+~\cdots~+~x_n}{n}$$

Or, written using summation notation:

$$\mu~=~\frac{\sum{x_i}_{i=1}^n}{n}$$

## Example

Suppose we ask 6 people how old they are and get the following dataset:

| Person | Age |
|:------:|:---:|
|   1    | 26  |
|   2    | 38  |
|   3    | 29  |
|   4    | 47  |
|   5    | 18  |
|   6    | 33  |

Now, to calculate the avergae age, we first add up all the values:

$$\sum{x_i}_{i=1}^n~=~26~+~38~+~29~+~47~+~18~+~33~=~191$$

Then, we divide by the number of people who answered:

$$\frac{191}{6}~=~31.8333\dots$$

We see then that the average age is $31.8333\dots$. Note how the average value doesn't have to be one of the values in the dataset (whereas the mode does).
