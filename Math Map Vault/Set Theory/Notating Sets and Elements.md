# Notating Sets and Elements

---

Our primary goal in set theory is exploring this notion of "collections" of objects. We want to do this from an abstract perspective, so in general we won't worry too much about what specific type of objects our elements are: we're going to focus much more on the properties of sets themselves.

The standard notation is to notate elements with lowercase English letters, using different letters to symbolize different (non-identical) elements. So for example the letters $x$, $y$, and $z$ would stand for three different elements which we might want to group together into a set. You can picture them as any objects you want, or you can just think of them as abstract representations of "some object" - as long as you picture different letters as representing different objects that's perfectly fine.

We'll also want to label our sets. The convention is to use uppercase English letters to represent sets. For example, we could have the sets $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.
