# Cardinality
Now that we understand that sets are collections of elements or, equivalently, elements are objects which are members of sets, we can start to investigate the properties of sets. **Cardinality** refers to the number of items which a set contains.

For example, the set $$A = \{x, y, z\}$$ has a cardinality of three. The set $$B = \{u, v\}$$ has a cardinality of two. The empty set $\emptyset$ has a cardinality of zero.
