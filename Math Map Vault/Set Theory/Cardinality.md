# Cardinality

Now that we understand that sets are collections of elements, it might make sense to define some notion of the "size" of a set. **Cardinality** refers to the number of elements in a set.

Examples:

- the set $D$ = \{days in the week\} has a cardinality of seven
- the set $M$ = \{months in the year\} has a cardinality of twelve
- the set $A = \{x, y, z\}$ has a cardinality of three
- the set $B = \{u, v\}$ has a cardinality of two

We notate the cardinality of a set by writing the name of the set sandwiched between two vertical bars. For example, say we have a set $$S = \{a\}$$

The cardinality of $S$ is clearly one, because there is only one element contained within $S$. We could write this with $$|S| = 1$$

As a last example, the cardinality of the four example sets from above would be written:

- $|D| = 7$
- $|M| = 12$
- $|A| = 3$
- $|B| = 2$

In the future, we will talk about sets with infinite cardinality, but for now, we will only deal with sets with a cardinality equal to a whole number: 1, 2, 3, etc.
