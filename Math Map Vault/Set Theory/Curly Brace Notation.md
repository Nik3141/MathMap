# Curly Brace Notation
**Curly brace notation** is a convenient way for us to write out the contents of a set. Say you have a set $A$ you want to fill with elements $m$ and $n$. You could write $$m, n \in A$$

or $$A \ni m, n$$

But there is another way: $$A = \{m, n\}$$

We simply write the elements that the set contains as a comma-separated list between the curly braces. As a reminder, remember that the lowercase letters stand for elements, while the uppercase $A$ is the set which groups the elements.

Note that whereas the $\in$ and $\ni$ notations are not exclusionary, **the curly brace notation is exclusionary**. What this means is that if you see $$x \in S$$
or $$S \ni x$$

that does not mean that $x$ is the only element in $S$. There could be other elements in $S$ we haven't talked about. However, if I write $$S = \{x\}$$

then that means that $x$ is the only element in $S$.

As another example, let's take the set $Z$ which we want to contain elements $u$, $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$, and $k$. So far, we've learned three ways to write it:

- $u, v, w, x, y, a, b, k \in Z$
- $Z \ni u, v, w, x, y, a, b, k$
- $Z = \{u, v, w, x, y, a, b, k\}$

We could also put a verbal description of the set within the curly braces. Some examples:
- $D$ = \{days in the week\}
- $M$ = \{months in the year\}
- $P$ = \{US Presidents\}
- $F$ = \{members of my family}
