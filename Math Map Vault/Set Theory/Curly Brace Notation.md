# Curly Brace Notation
**Curly brace notation** is a convenient way for us to write out the contents of a set. Say you have a set $A$ you want to fill with elements $m$ and $n$. You could write $$m, n \in A$$

or $$A \ni m, n$$

But there is another way: $$A = \{m, n\}$$

We simply write the elements that the set contains as a comma-separated list between the curly braces.

As another example, let's take the set $Z$ which we want to contain elements $u$, $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$, and $k$. So far, we've learned three ways to write it:

- $u, v, w, x, y, a, b, k \in Z$
- $Z \ni u, v, w, x, y, a, b, k$
- $Z = \{u, v, w, x, y, a, b, k\}$

Remember that the lowercase letters stand for elements, while the uppercase $Z$ is the set which contains the elements. In our analogy, the elements are objects we put in the box we've labeled $Z$.
