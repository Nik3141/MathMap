# Notating Non-membership

---

Just as we have two notations to express membership:

- $\in$
- $\ni$

we also have two notations to express non-membership:

- $\not\in$
- $\not\ni$

We can use the $\not\in$ symbol to show that some object is not in some set. For example, if $D$ is the set of days in the week, $James \not\in D$ would mean that "'James' is not in the set D".

Similarly, the $\not\ni$ symbol shows that some set does not contain some element. If $D$ again is the set of days in the week, $D \not\ni James$ would mean "the set D does not contain 'James'".

Having all of these notations can be confusing, so here's what they all mean in a concise list:

- $x \in S$ means "x is in S"
- $S \ni x$ means "S contains x"
- $x \not\in S$ means "x is not in S"
- $S \not\ni x$ means "S doesn't contain x"
