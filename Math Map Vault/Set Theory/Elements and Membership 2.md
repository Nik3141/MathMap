# Elements and Membership 2
Let's now examine some examples where we put multiple items into a set. Suppose that we have a set $X$ and we want to put elements $a$, $b$, and $c$ inside of it. We would say that $$a, b, c \in X$$

which could be read as:
- "a, b, and c are inside X"
- "a, b, and c are elements of X"
- "a, b, and c are members of X"

We could say the same thing with $$X \ni a, b, c$$

which would be read as "X contains a, b, and c".

We're not too concerned about what type of things $a$, $b$, and $c$ are. They could stand for numbers, cars, puppies, or people - it makes no difference to us right now. We just care about the concept of putting elements inside of sets. If picturing them as objects to put in a box helps you, go for it. If you're perfectly fine picturing this abstract idea of grouping elements together in a set, that's great too.

Continuing our example from earlier, I could say that if the set $D$ is the set of days, then
$$Monday,\ Tuesday,\ Wednesday,\ Thursday,\ Friday,\ Saturday,\ Sunday\ \in D$$
