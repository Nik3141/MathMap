# Elements and Membership 2
Let's now examine some examples where we group multiple items together into a set. Suppose that we have a set $X$ and we want to put elements $a$, $b$, and $c$ inside of it. We would say that $$a, b, c \in X$$

which could be read as:
- "a, b, and c are inside X"
- "a, b, and c are elements of X"
- "a, b, and c are members of X"

We could say the same thing with $$X \ni a, b, c$$

which would be read as "X contains a, b, and c".

We're not too concerned about what type of things $a$, $b$, and $c$ are. They could stand for numbers, cars, puppies, or people - it makes no difference to us right now. We just care about the concept of grouping elements inside of sets.

Continuing our example from earlier, I could say that if the set $D$ is the set of days, then
$$Monday,\ Wednesday,\ Friday \in D$$

And just like the $\in$ symbol has a counterpart in $\not\in$, the $\ni$ symbol has a counterpart in $\not\ni$, which means "doesn't contain". To make it really clear, here's what they all mean:

- $x \in S$ means that $x$ is in the set $S$
- $S \ni x$ means that the set $S$ contains $x$
- $x \not\in S$ means that $x$ is not in the set $S$
- $S \not\ni x$ means that the set $S$ does not contain $x$

$x \in S$ and $S \ni x$ are interchangeable
$x \not\in S$ and $S \not\ni x$ are interchangeable
