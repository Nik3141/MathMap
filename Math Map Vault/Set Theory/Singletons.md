# Singletons

---

**Singleton** is a word used to refer to any set with a cardinality of one. In other words, a singleton is a set which contains one element. There are infinitely many possible singletons. Some examples would be:
- $A$ = \{Jason\}
- $B$ = \{Beethoven's Fifth Symphony\}
- $C$ = $\{17\}$

Keep in mind that although a singleton has only one element, it is still a collection and is not the same as the element contained within it. So $\{a\}$ is not the same as $a$.
