# Sets, Elements, and Membership

---

The most basic concept of set theory is, as the name suggests, the **set**. A set is a grouping or collection of objects. You've probably heard the word 'set' used in this fashion before, for example

- "a set of silverware"
- "a chess set"
- "a set of choices"
- "a train set"

Everyday life is filled with examples of sets:

- the collection of kids in Mr. Miller's class are a set
- the books on my bookshelf could form a set
- the people who are in Classroom 17 at 1:13pm on Monday, March 1st, 2021 form a set
- the days in a week are a set
- the months in a year are a set

The objects which we group within sets are called **elements** (or sometimes **members**), and the relationship between an element and a set which contains it - namely, the relation of the element "belonging" to the set or being "inside" of the set - is called the **membership relation**.

As an example, we would say that "Monday" is an element of (or member of) the set of days in the week. Similarly, "Tuesday", "Wednesday" and "Thursday" are members of that set. In this case, the set itself isn't "the week" - it's just this grouping we've created with all of the days. Sets are somewhat analogous to categories in this way: they're not necessarily 'things' in their own right other than being something which groups multiple items together. For example, the category "mammals" isn't a 'thing', per se, but we can talk about it and say that humans belong to this category.

This similarity between sets and categories may have given you the impression that a set should contain elements which follow some pattern or have something in common (like having the same teacher, or being on the same bookshelf). It's certainly possible that some sets are like this, but sets don't have to be like that: they can contain completely arbitrary elements. The following objects:

- my phone
- President Joe "No Malarkey" Biden
- the Pacific Ocean
- the moon

could all be in a set together, because a set is just a grouping/collection *we create*. In naive set theory, a set can be any collection of elements you want, subject to two restrictions:

- sets cannot contain repeat elements
- the elements in sets are unordered

This basically means that no set can contain two copies of the same object, and there are no "first", "second", "third", etc elements in a set.
