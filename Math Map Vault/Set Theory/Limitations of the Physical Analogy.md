# Limitations of the Physical Analogy
Our box analogy has us picture sets as labeled containers where we can put all manner of objects (as long as we don't put any repeat elements). It's a useful analogy because it gives students a non-abstract way to conceptualize sets, elements, and membership. However, it has some limitations, namely that it reinforces some misconceptions students often have about sets:

- First of all, the very nature of the phrase "put in" implies that a physical action has occurred and time has passed; this is not accurate. In set theory, we *define* a set to be a collection of certain elements, and it instantaneously pops into existence as soon as we do so. For example, the statement $$M = \{p, q\}$$

	says that $M$ has two elements, $p$ and $q$. It might be tempting to think of us starting with an empty set, then adding $p$, then adding $q$. But in reality, the set appeared with both elements as soon as we thought of it, because by thinking of those elements as a group, we created the group. And a set is just our word for the grouping/collection of objects. Furthermore, say that we decided to write another statement: $$M = \{p\}$$

	It would certainly be convenient to say that we "removed" $q$, but this type of physically-oriented thinking isn't quite accurate. It's more accurate to say that we "redefined" $M$ to be the collection containing one element: $p$.

- Another related issue with our physical shoebox analogy is that the concept of "putting in" implies an order. However, as we mentioned before, sets are completely unordered. There is no "first" or "second" or "third" element in a set: every element is jumbled together. The statements $S = \{a, b\}$ and $S = \{b, a\}$ are identical from a set theory perspective.

- The final big issue with the shoebox analogy is that it implies that the set is an actual container. This is a good way to think about it, but it's important to realize that a "set" is just the collection of objects as a whole. It's not a "container" per se but is more accurately the name for the group.
