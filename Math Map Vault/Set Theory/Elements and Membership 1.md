# Elements and Membership 1
**Elements** (sometimes called **members**) are the objects we group within sets, and the relationship between an element and the set it belongs to is called the **membership relation**.

As an example, we would say that "Monday" is an element of (or member of) the set of days in the week. Similarly, "Tuesday", "Wednesday" and "Thursday" are members of that set.

The convention is that while sets are labeled with uppercase English letters, elements are labeled with lowercase English letters. Let's say that we have some object which we'll call $x$. If we want $x$ to be an element of some set $S$, we can use the symbol for membership, which looks like this: $\in$

$\in$ means "in", so to show that $x$ is an element of $S$ we can write $$x \in S$$

This means "x is in S". It could also be read as:

- "x is an element of S"
- "x is a member of S"

Using our days in the week example, if the set $D$ is the collection of all of the days in the week, then we could show that 'Monday' is an element of $D$ with $$Monday \in D$$

Note that $\in$ does not imply exclusionary membership. If I write that $Monday \in D$, it doesn't mean that there are no other elements contained within $D$, just that one of the elements in $D$ is 'Monday'. It's possible that 'Monday' is the only element, but we don't know based only on the statement $Monday \in D$.

Finally, we can use the $\not\in$ symbol to show that some object is *not* in some set. For example, $James \not\in D$ would mean that "James is not in the set D", which makes sense, because 'James' isn't a day of the week.
