# Membership Rules

---

There are two very important rules to remember when dealing with sets. I mentioned them at the beginning, but I think it's beneficial to remind ourselves of them:

- **No set can contain repeats of the same element multiple times.** Writing $S = \{f, f\}$ just doesn't make sense in set theory. One way to think about it is that if you try to put multiple copies of the same object in a set, they get squished together into one copy of the object. So in the example above, the multiple $f$'s would get squished together into one $f$, and we'd get that $S = \{f\}$.
	
- **Objects in sets are unordered.** The statements
	
	- $A = \{j, k, l\}$
	- $A = \{j, l, k\}$
	- $A = \{k, l, j\}$
	- $A = \{k, j, l\}$
	- $A = \{l, j, k\}$
	- $A = \{l, k, j\}$
		
	are identical from a set theory perspective, because the three elements grouped together in $A$ are the same no matter which order they're in. Similarly, the statements $a, b \in S$ and $b, a \in S$ have identical meanings. The set $S$ that results is the same for both statements.
