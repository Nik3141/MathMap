# Introduction to Set Theory

---

**Set theory** is an extremely important branch of math. Almost every mathematical subject can be expressed using set theory concepts: number theory, algebra, geometry, calculus, you name it...they all boil down to set theory. And on top of that, there are many branches of math which simply wouldn't exist without set theory, such as point-set topology or abstract algebra.

Set theory is quite abstract - it needs flexibility to be able to serve as a foundation for all of those other fields of math - and this can initially make it a bit difficult to grasp. However, if you stick with it, you'll be well rewarded. The deeper understanding of mathematics you gain by viewing it through the lens of set theory is definitely worth the effort.

The most basic notions of set theory are those of the **set** and the **element**. In short, a set can be thought of as a collection of objects, while elements are objects which are grouped together within sets. Set theory is concerned with the properties of sets, elements, and the relationships between them, as well as the properties of other set-like objects.

There are two types of set theory: "naive" set theory and "axiomatic" set theory. Naive set theory is great for learning the basic concepts, but we'll eventually run into problems that we'll need axiomatic set theory to solve.

This sequence aims to give a complete explanation of both the concepts of naive set theory and the notations used to represent those concepts. After that, we'll revisit all of those topics from an axiomatic set theory perspective.
