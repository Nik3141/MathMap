# Proper Subsets and Proper Supersets
A set $X$ is a **subset** of a set $Y$ if all elements in $X$ are also in $Y$. For example, suppose that $$X = \{a, c\}$$ $$Y = \{a, b, c, d\}$$

All of the elements in $X$ are also contained in $Y$, so $X$ is a subset of $Y$. The subset symbol is $\subseteq$, so we would write: $$X \subseteq Y$$

One way to remember it is that it's a little bit like the 'less than or equal to' symbol:
- $\subseteq$
- $\le$

**Superset** is the term we use if we look at the situation the other way around. If a set $Y$ contains all of the elements in $X$, then we would say $Y$ is a superset of $X$. The symbol for superset is $\supseteq$, so we would write: $$Y \supseteq X$$

One way to remember it is that it's a little bit like the 'greater than or equal to' symbol:
- $\supseteq$
- $\ge$
