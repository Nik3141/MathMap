# 'In' vs 'Contains' Notation
You might see the symbol $\ni$ sometimes. It's the inverse of the $\in$ symbol. Whereas $\in$ means "in", $\ni$ means "contains".

This symbol is simply a different way to express the membership relation, where the set which groups the elements is written before the actual elements. So as an example, $$Z \ni n$$

means the same thing as $$n \in Z$$

They both say the same thing, but they each say it in different ways. The first one says "Z contains n" while the second one says "n is in Z".

Say that $M$ is the set of months in the year. We could write either $$January \in M$$
or $$M \ni January$$

This would say that "'January' is an element of M" or "M contains 'January'".

Note that like $\ni$, like $\in$, is not exclusionary. Writing $January \in M$ or $M \ni January$ doesn't mean that 'January' is the only element in $M$. It just asserts that one of the elements in $M$ is 'January'.

Also note that the standard notation is that you use $\in$, not $\ni$.
