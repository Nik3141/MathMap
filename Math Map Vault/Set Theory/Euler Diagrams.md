# Euler Diagrams

Now that we've got the basics of sets, elements, and membership down, it'll be very helpful to be able to represent these concepts graphically. **Euler diagrams** allow us to do this by representing sets as circles. We then write the elements of a set inside of the circle which represents it.

For example, say we have the set $S = \{a, b, c\}$. We could represent this set using an Euler diagram like so:

<html>

		<svg width="200" height="200">
			<circle cx="100" cy="100" r="90" stroke="white" stroke-width="4" fill="none"/>
			<text x="25" y="25" fill="white">S</text>
			<text x="90" y="80" fill="white">a</text>
			<text x="70" y="130" fill="white">b</text>
			<text x="120" y="110" fill="white">c</text>
		</svg>
