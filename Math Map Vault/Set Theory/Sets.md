# Sets 
The most basic object of set theory is, as the name suggests, the **set**. A set is a grouping or collection of objects. You've probably heard the word 'set' used in this fashion before, for example

- "a set of silverware"
- "a chess set"
- "a set of choices"
- "a train set"

Everyday life is filled with examples of sets:

- the collection of kids in Mr. Miller's class are a set
- the books on my bookshelf could be a set
- the people who are in Classroom 17 at 1:13pm on Monday, March 1st, 2021 form a set
- the days in a week are a set
- the months in a year are a set

In naive set theory, a set can be any collection or grouping of objects you want.

The examples above may have given you the impression that a set should contain things which follow some pattern or have something in common (like having the same teacher, or being on the same bookshelf). It's certainly possible that some sets are like this, but sets don't have to be: they can contain completely arbitrary objects. The following objects:
- my phone
- President Joe "No Malarkey" Biden
- the microphone of popular Twitch streamer "Vaush"
- the person behind the YouTube channel "Second Thought"

could all be in a set together, because a set is just a grouping/collection we create.

Because we'll be dealing with many different sets, we'll want to label them so we can tell them apart. The convention is to use uppercase English letters to represent sets. Let's say that our first set is called $S$. For now, $S$ is empty because we haven't grouped anything inside of it.
