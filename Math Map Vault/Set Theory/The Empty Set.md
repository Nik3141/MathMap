# The Empty Set

---

The set with a cardinality of zero is known as the **empty set** or the **null set**. This is a very special set because it is unique: whereas there are infinitely many sets with a cardinality of one, two, three, etc, there is only one set with _nothing_ inside of it. As such, the empty set gets a special symbol: $\emptyset$.
