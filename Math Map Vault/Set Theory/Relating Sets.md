# Relating Sets
When given two numbers, we can compare them and say that one is

- $\ge$ greater than or equal to
- $\le$ less than or equal to
- = equal to
- $\gt$ greater than
- $\lt$ less than

the other. We now want to build a similar notion for sets, based on the elements they contain. The four relations above have analogues in set theory:

- Supersets
- Subsets
- Set Equality
- Proper Supersets
- Proper Subsets
