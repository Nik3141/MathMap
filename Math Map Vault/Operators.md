# Operators

---

The concept of **operators** is fundamental to mathematics. Operators are special mathematical objects which allow us to combine or modify other types of mathematical objects. For example, 'addition' is an operator which allows us to modify numbers.

We will rigorously define operators later down the line, but for now this informal understanding will be sufficient.
