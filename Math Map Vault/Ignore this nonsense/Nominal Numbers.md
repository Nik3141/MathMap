#ignore_this
Even before students can count, they can use numbers to refer to objects. This is using numbers in the context of **nominality**.

Something important to emphasize is that the nominal number assigned to an item has no bearing on its ordinality in the context of a list or on the cardinality of a group that it's in. For example, the fact that racecar 57 is on the track doesn't mean that it is in 57th place or that there are 57 racecars on the track.
