There are various ways to measure distance in a given [[Coordinate Systems|coordinate system]].

One is to use Euclidean distance. This method is a very natural, intuitive way to measure distances.

For two points $A(x_1,~y_1)$ and $B(x_2,~y_2)$, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is equal to $\sqrt{(x_2~-~x_1)^2~+~(y_2~-~y_1)^2}$.

For example,
