First of all, welcome! Thanks for checking out the map.

If you have questions about anything just ask me in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dvW2HzBCMG)

[[Vision Statement]] contains the vision for what the map is going to end up looking like.

[[Sample Note]] contains all of the formatting information you'll need for creating a new note for the map, as well as some basic guidance. If you just look around at the notes already created you should get a feel for what they should look like pretty quickly.

[[Add These]] contains subjects we're working on adding, hopefully in the relative order we want to add them. 

[[Sample Curriculum]] contains some of the Common Core math curriculum for the state of California. It's just a reference page.

Want to write a note, but not sure where to put it yet? Link to it from incomplete notes! (Not linked to keep this note separated from that mess).

Anything tagged `#ignore_this` should be ignored because it's not currently part of the map. Things tagged with that are leftovers from earlier drafts or partial ideas which need some serious thought put into how they should be integrated into the map.
