# CONTRIBUTOR HUB

---

First of all, welcome! Thanks for checking out the map. First of all, if you have questions about anything feel free to ask in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dvW2HzBCMG)

Secondly, please go look over the content we have so far, starting at "Introduction to Mathematics" (which is in neon green). This is so you can understand how we're trying to organize the map, as well as get a feel for the style we're going for with the notes. Then go check out the [[Vision Statement]], which contains the vision for what the map is going to end up looking like.

Some ways you can contribute (besides just spreading the word about the project):
- Write a segment (or just a note) about a mathematical topic which hasn't been covered yet. Make sure to link this to 'Incomplete Notes' for a project manager to link into the main map.
- Edit a note to make it clearer, more accurate, more accessible/less wordy, or better in general.
- Reorganize some segment to make sure that each concept flows from the previous in a natural way, and that the title of each note is as accurate and simple as possible.

[[Sample Note]] contains all of the formatting information you'll need for creating a new note for the map, as well as some basic guidance. If you just look around at the notes already created you should get a feel for what they should look like pretty quickly.

[[Add These]] contains subjects we're working on adding, hopefully in the relative order we want to add them. 

[[Sample Curriculum]] contains some of the Common Core math curriculum for the state of California. It's just a reference page.
