# Sample Note

---

As you can see, this **sample note** has the name of the idea/concept it's about in bold. The top line has a subject tag, the next line has the name of the idea/concept as a header (and is the same as the note name), and the third line is just a horizontal rule:

```
#tag

# Header

```

After this, text is broken up into paragraphs however you think is appropriate. All different paragraphs should have line breaks between them whenever possible. All math notation should be in $LaTeX$, and you can use SVG graphics or HTML tables as additional learning aids. Bulleted lists could be used in the following situations:

- when appropriate to emphasize a list of things or a sequence of actions
- to draw attention to certain conditions something must meet
- to demonstrate the steps required for some process
- or whenever you feel like it would help with presenting the information

All notes should strive to be as atomized as possible while still being reasonably self-contained. If you've got three or four related small topics, consider joining them all together under a common umbrella in a single note. Try to keep explanations as simple and redundant as possible. Make sure to imply nothing: say everything explicitly. Use no topics which haven't been previously covered (if you notice you have relied on something not yet covered, add it to the 'Add These' document).

If you don't know where to put a note, put it in Unfinished notes. Try not to link to any other notes in the 'body' of the note: we're not trying to create a web of connected ideas but a straightforward progression of ideas. Giving people many choices of where to go at each note will likely confuse them.
