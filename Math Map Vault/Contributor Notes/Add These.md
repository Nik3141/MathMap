**Misc Notes:**
Set Theory has to come from arithmetic or at least come after counting
venn diagrams to the set theory segment
sets of numbers: natural numbers, integers, rationals, irrationals, transcendentals, real numbers, complex numbers, constructable numbers, etc

Logistic Growth
Exponential Growth
Logarithmic Growth

Connect sets to logic
Connect logic to sets (use logic to show how proof by contradiction works, for example, and then connect that to subsets and supersets to prove that for any set $S$ the null set is a subset)
Propositions are closed under logical operations
data representation such as tables

Homeomorphism - continuous deformation between topological spaces
f is bijective, f is continuous, and the pre-image of f is continuous


**Galois Theory Notes:**
Allows us to determine whether there is an equation to solve a polynomial.

Fields are basically sets that are closed under the four arithmetic operations.

Field Extensions are what we get when we take a field and append all of the elements we can get by combining arithmetically (a finite number of times) elements already in the set with a certain element not in the set.

So for example the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are a field, and we can create a field extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ which will be the set of all numbers $x + y\sqrt{2}$ where $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$.
