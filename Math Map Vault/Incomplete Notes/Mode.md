# Mode
---
The _mode_ of a sample is the most frequently occuring value; the value which appears the "most" in a sample.

A sample can have 
- one mode (called a _unimodal_ sample), 
- two modes (called a _bimodal_), or 
- multiple modes (called a _multimodal_ sample).

## Example

### Unimodal

Consider the sample:

$$\{5,~3,~2,~9,~6,~3,~6,~5,~3\}$$

We see that the value $3$ appears the most, and therefore this is the mode of the sample.

### Bimodal

Consider the sample:

$$\{5,~3,~2,~5,~6,~3,~6,~5,~3\}$$

We see that both $5$ and $3$ appear three times. Therefore this sample is bimodal.

### Multimodal

Consider the sample:

$$\{5,~3,~6,~5,~6,~3,~6,~5,~3\}$$

We see that $3$, $5$, and $6$ all appear three times. Therefore this sample is multimodal.
