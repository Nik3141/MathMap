# Slope

---

The _slope_, or gradient, between two points is a measure of the "steepness" from the first to the second (usually going from left-to-right).

In general, for two points $A(x_1,~y_1)$ and $B(x_2,~y_2)$, the slope between $A$ and $B$ is $\frac{y_2~-~y_1}{x_2~-~x_1}$, more simply referred to as $\frac{\Delta~y}{\Delta~x}$, where $\Delta~y~=~y_2~-~y_1$.

For example,
