# Negation

---

The **negation** (sometimes called the **logical complement**) of a proposition results in a different proposition which always has the opposite truth value.

Suppose that we have a proposition which we represent with the propositional variable $P$. The negation of $P$ would be the proposition which always has the opposite truth value as $P$:

- If $P$ is true, the negation of $P$ is false.
- If $P$ is false, the negation of $P$ is true.

| $P$     | $\neg~P$ |
| ------- | -------- |
| `True`  | `False`  |
| `False` | `True`   |

We symbolize the negation of a proposition by putting either a $\neg$ or a \~ sign in front of it. They both mean the same thing, and are read as "not". So the negation of our proposition $P$ could be symbolized with $\neg P$ or \~$P$, and would be read as "not $P$".

Given any proposition, the negation can be obtained by adding a "not" into the proposition. This is why we read the negation of $P$ as "not $P$".

Say that proposition $P$ asserts that "The sky is blue." Then the negation of proposition $P$ would be "The sky is **not** blue." Let's check to make sure it's correct:

- If the sky is blue, then $P$ must be true, whereas $\neg P$ must be false.
- If the sky is not blue, then $P$ must be false, whereas $\neg P$ must be true.

The sky must either be blue or it must be not blue, so we've checked all cases, and in all cases the negation of $P$ has the opposite truth value as $P$.

Let's see a few more examples:
- $Q$ is "I am a dog."
	- $\neg Q$ is "I am not a dog."
- $R$ is "I am 2.1 meters tall."
	- $\neg R$ is "I am not 2.1 meters tall."
