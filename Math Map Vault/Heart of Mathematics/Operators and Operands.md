# Operators and Operands

---

**Operators** are special mathematical objects which allow us to combine or modify other mathematical objects. **Operands** are the objects which are combined or modified by operators. For example, 'addition' is an operator which allows us to modify numbers by adding them together. The numbers we add using addition are the operands.

The concept of operators is fundamental to mathematics, so we will rigorously define them later down the line, but for now this informal understanding will be sufficient.
