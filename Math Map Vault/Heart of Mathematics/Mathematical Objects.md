# Mathematical Objects

---

If mathematics is the study of precisely defined abstract objects, then it makes sense for us to precisely define what we mean by an "abstract object". An **abstract object** is any idea that we create which has properties. For example, numbers have the property of 'size'. Once we define what properties an object has, we can use those properties and the principles of logic to extrapolate what other properties it has.

We can define mathematical objects both 'informally' and 'formally' (which is sometimes called 'rigorously'). We will often begin by first defining a concept informally, which means we will likely use lots of analogies so we can get the basic intuition down. Then, we'll circle back around and define it formally using proofs (arguments made using logical reasoning).
