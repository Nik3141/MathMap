# Notation

---

It's extremely important to have a precise and concise way of communicating mathematical ideas through writing. This is the purpose of **notation**. Notation is essentially the written language of mathematics which we use to symbolize mathematical objects (as well as their properties) on paper. For example, we use notation (in the form of numerals) to represent numbers; we use letters to represent variables; and we use the 'plus sign' ($+$) to represent the addition operator.
