# Introduction to Mathematics

Different people have vastly differing perceptions of mathematics. It's a source of interesting puzzles and patterns for some, and a disorganized mess of numbers and symbols for others. Some people see it as a tool for analyzing trends, managing sums of money, or modeling scientific phenomena, while yet others see it as an art and a thing of beauty - a network of logical threads which weave together to create humankind's most extensive sculpture.

My personal opinion is that mathematics is the study of precisely-definted abstract objects: things like numbers, shapes, functions, vectors, etc. These abstract objects might be interesting in their own right, or they might turn out to have useful real-life applications in fields as varied as genetics, computation, economics, and condensed-matter physics. And it often turns out that the mathematical innovations of a few decades ago which originally seemed useless come to be the foundations of wild, newly established fields of science.

Mathematics plays a huge part in modern technology, and through its applications in science it allows you to better understand how the universe works. As such, I feel that mathematics is an extremely important subject to be proficient in. Whether you need to manage your family's money, discern between true and false conclusions based on statistics, write a computer program, or build some type of mechanical device, a solid knowledge of mathematics will help you significantly.

In my experience, the mathematics taught in schools is a disorganized patchwork of ideas held together by grade levels and units. This map is an attempt to change that. It's based around a subject called "set theory", which can be used to construct almost all of mathematics, and which almost all of mathematics can be tied back to. The goal is that mathematics as presented here feels like an organized progression based around some central concepts, which you can work through at whatever pace is right for you to achieve mastery.

Additionally, this map assumes no prior mathematical knowledge and no mathematical maturity (the ability to read proofs and such), and is atomized as much as possible (meaning each concept/skill is separated from other concepts whenever possible). As such, it can be used as an education tool for parents/guardians/teachers of students. Right now, it only contains explanations of topics, along with examples. In the future, the plan is to add on practice exercises at certain intervals throughout the map.

Regardless of your past experience with mathematics, I hope that this mathematics map can help you learn something new or come to see something you already knew about in a different light.
