# Vision Statement

---

The goal of this math map is to provide a self-contained resource which allows anybody, regardless of prior mathematical knowledge, ability, or maturity, to learn any mathematical topic they want.

To this end, the goal is that all of K-12 mathematics would be structured around arithmetic, naive set theory and basic first- and second- order logic.

Although we're using Obsidian for this project, the goal is not to create a web of ideas as is normal in Obsidian. We don't want to recreate Wikipedia, with its plethora of inline links. Instead, we want to create a well-curated and straightfoward progression from the very beginnings of mathematics all the way to its extremities, so that the connections between topics can be seen, but so that the content, not the connections, is the focus.
