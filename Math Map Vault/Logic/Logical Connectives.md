# Logical Connectives

---

Now that we understand the basics of propositions, we can move on to learning how to combine them. **Logical connectives** allow us to do just that by joining two propositions together to form a new proposition.

The connectives are analogous to the [[Operators|operators]] we learned about earlier.

There are four basic logical connectives (which along with "negation" form the five logical operators, but we'll learn about that later):

- [[Disjunction]]
- [[Conjunction]]
- [[Conditional]]
- [[Biconditional]]
