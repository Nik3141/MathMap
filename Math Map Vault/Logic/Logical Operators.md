# Logical Operators
Now that we understand the basics of propositions, we can move on to learning how to combine and manipulate them. **Logical operators** (also called **logical connectives**) allow us to do just that.

There are two categories of logical operators. **Unary logical operators** modify the value of a single proposition. There is only of unary logical operator: [[Negation]]

**Binary logical operators** combine 

meaning you can create a proposition about the propositions; for example, "$\phi$ and $\psi$ are both true." is a proposition (let's call it $X$) which itself can be true or false. We will investigate this more in the next section: [[Atomic]]
