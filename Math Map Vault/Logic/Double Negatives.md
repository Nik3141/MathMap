# Double Negatives
---
What happens if we negate a proposition which already has a "not" in it? For example, suppose that proposition $R$ says "I am not happy." Following our rules from before, $\neg R$ would be "I am not not happy." This is known as a **double negative**.

An important property of double negatives is that they cancel out. Hopefully this makes sense: if someone tells you to "not not do some thing", they're really just telling you to do that thing.

Let's say we have a proposition $S$ which says "I am happy." Remember that $R$ says "I am not happy." Clearly, $R$ is the negation of $S$ (which is $\neg S$).

Thus, the negation of $R$ (which is $\neg R$) would simply be the double negation of $S$ (which is $\neg \neg S$).
