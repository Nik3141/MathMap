# Introduction to Propositional Logic
---
**Propositional logic** is often called "zeroth-order logic" because it is one of the most fundamental types of logic. It is often used as a foundation to build more complicated systems of logic, such as first-order logic (which in turn can be used to build second-order logic, etc).

In short, propositional logic allows us to evaluate, combine, and otherwise manipulate statements we call "propositions". These propositions can only be assigned 'true' or 'false' truth values.
