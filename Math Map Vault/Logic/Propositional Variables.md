# Propositional Variables

---

It is often useful to represent propositions using symbols. We call these symbols **propositional variables**. We usually use uppercase English letters or lowercase Greek letters for these. For example, we can assert that $P$ represents the proposition "Dori's birthday is on April twentieth".

Some more examples:
- $Q$ could represent the proposition "Marge is in a playground."
- $\phi$ could represent the proposition "Aleph is a Hebrew letter."
- $\psi$ could represent the proposition "Debussy was not an impressionist composer."

Note that in the examples above, each proposition has a truth value. For example, the proposition $\phi$ (phi) has the truth value 'true' assigned to it (because aleph is indeed a Hebrew letter). As another example, $\psi$ (psi) has the truth value 'false' assigned to it (because Debussy was in fact an impressionist composer).

The reason we want to use propositional variables to represent propositions (rather than just writing each proposition out) is because our goal in studying propositional logic is to build rules about how we can combine and manipulate propositions. For our rules to be useful, they need to apply *universally* (meaning they should apply to all propositions), so it's helpful if we can model every proposition in the same way.
