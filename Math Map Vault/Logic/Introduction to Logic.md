# Introduction to Logic

---

When you and I are speaking, we can say many different things in many different ways. We can make statements about all manner of people, objects, events, and more, and the somewhat miraculous thing is that we can all understand each other.

The field of logic tries to understand the meaning we can convey using language and investigates properties of meaning such as truthfulness. It does this in a more formal way than our everyday natural language we use when speaking. It creates rules to fashion a systematic lens through which we can view and understand meaning and language.

There are many different types of logic which explore meaning at different levels. As such, logic is an extremely useful subject with applications in other fields such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and law.
