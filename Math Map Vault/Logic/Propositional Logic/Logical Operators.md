# Logical Operators

---

Let's say that we have two propositions:

- $P$ says "Ted likes pie."
- $Q$ says "Ted likes ice cream."

We can combine these propositions to make bigger propositions. For example:

- "Ted likes pie **and** Ted likes ice cream."
- "Ted likes pie **or** Ted likes ice cream."
- "**If** Ted likes pie, **then** Ted likes ice cream."
- "Ted likes pie **only if** Ted likes ice cream."
- "**Either** Ted likes pie **or** Ted likes ice cream."

Each of these sentences is a statement which asserts something. Each of these statements can be either true or false. So each of these statements is a proposition. Clearly none of them have the same meaning, yet somehow we've created all of them using the same two basic propositions, $P$ and $Q$. How did we do this?

These new, more complex propositions were created using certain 'connecting words', which in the field of logic are called 'logical operators'. **Logical operators** allow us to modify or combine one or more propositions to obtain new, more complex propositions, which depend on the truth values of the propositions which make them up.

There are many logical operators, but the interesting thing is that given one or two carefully chosen logical operators to work with, you can actually recreate the behavior of all of the other logical operators.
