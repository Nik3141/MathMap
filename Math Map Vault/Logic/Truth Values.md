# Truth Values

---

An important elementary concept in logic are **truth values**. A truth value can be thought of as an indication of "how true" something is. Different types of logic allow different truth values.

In many types of logic, the only two truth values permitted are 'true' and 'false', which are represented in four main ways:

- True/False
- T/F
- $1$/$0$
- ON/OFF

True/False and T/F are most often found in classic logic, while $1$/$0$ and ON/OFF are most often found when dealing with computers. There are no intermediate or other values allowed. Other types of logic have more exotic conceptions of truth.

Some systems might take into account the probability of something being true or false when assigning a truth value.

Other systems might conceptualize truth as a scale from 0 (false) to 1 (true). In such a system, the statement "It is hot" might have a truthfulness of 0.8 when it is 30$^{\circ}$C but 0.7 when it is 25$^{\circ}$C.
