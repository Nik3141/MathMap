A **proposition** is simply a word mathematicians use for a statement which asserts something and has the property of being either true or false, but not both (nor neither).

In other words, for a statement to be a valid proposition, you must be able to assign one and only one truth value to it, where the only allowed truth values are 'true' and 'false'.

Some examples of valid propositions:
- *"Jellyfish are spineless animals."*
- *"Humans are reptiles."*
- *"Mature human red blood cells don't have nuclei."*

The examples above are valid propositions because one and only one true/false truth value can be assigned to each of them:
- #1 is true: jellyfish are indeed invertebrates (animals that do not have spines).
- #2 is false: humans are actually mammals, not reptiles.
- #3 is true: human red blood cells do lose their nuclei during maturation.

Note that the truth value assigned to a proposition has no bearing on it being valid or not.

Some examples of statements which are *not* propositions:
- *"Do not go to the store today.""*
- *"What are you doing?"*
- *"This statement is false."*

#1 is a command and asserts nothing, so it is neither true nor false and is thus not a proposition.

#2 asks a question and asserts nothing, so likewise it is neither true nor false and is thus not a proposition.

#3 is interesting because although it is a statement which asserts something, it is not a valid proposition. To see why, let's assume first that the statement is true, then that the statement is false:

- If the statement is true, then the statement's assertion that it is false must be true. This implies that the statement is both true and false.

- If the statement is false, then the statement's assertion that it is false must be false, meaning that it is true. This implies that the statement is both true and false.

Because propositions have to be *either* true or false, not both, the statement "This statement is false" cannot be a proposition, even though it does assert something.

In summary, valid propositions must have the following properties:

- Is a statement which asserts something.
- Is not a command nor a question.
- Is either true or false.
