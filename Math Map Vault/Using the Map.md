# Using the Map

---

This map is broken up into "sequences", which are relatively short, linear progressions of notes which describe one topic. In general, notes in the middle of sequences won't connect to notes in other sequences, so in any given sequence there are relatively few paths you can take. Hopefully this will minimize confusion and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed.

Throughout this map, the main pattern of presentation is that a mathematical object (along with its basic properties) is defined at the beginning of a "sequence". We then explain the notation used to represent the object, and the rest of the sequence is spent exploring various other properties of interest. The goal is that the tails of sequences link to the heads of others which would logically follow.
