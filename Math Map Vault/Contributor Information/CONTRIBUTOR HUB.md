First of all, welcome! Thanks for checking out the map. First of all, if you have questions about anything feel free to ask in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dvW2HzBCMG)

Secondly, please go check out the [[Vision Statement]], so you can get an idea of the philosophy and goals behind this project. Then, go look over the content we have so far, starting at "Introduction to Mathematics" (which is in neon green). This is so you can understand how we're trying to organize the map, as well as get a feel for the style we're going for with the notes.

Some ways you can contribute (besides just spreading the word about the project):
- Write a segment (or just a note) about a mathematical topic which hasn't been covered yet. Make sure to link to this from 'Incomplete Notes' for a project manager to link into the main map.
- Edit a note to make it clearer, more accurate, more accessible/less wordy, or better in general.
- Reorganize some segment to make sure that each concept flows from the previous in a natural way, and that the title of each note is as accurate and simple as possible.

[[Sample Note]] contains all of the formatting information you'll need for creating a new note for the map, as well as some basic guidance. If you just look around at the notes already created you should get a feel for what they should look like pretty quickly.

[[Add These]] contains subjects we intend to add.

[[Road Map]] is a road map for the project, with priorities and sequence planning and such.
