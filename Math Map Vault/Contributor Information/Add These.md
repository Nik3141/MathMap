data representation such as tables

Homeomorphism - continuous deformation between topological spaces
f is bijective, f is continuous, and the pre-image of f is continuous

**Galois Theory Notes:**
Allows us to determine whether there is an equation to solve a polynomial.

Fields are basically sets that are closed under the four arithmetic operations.

Field Extensions are what we get when we take a field and append all of the elements we can get by combining arithmetically (a finite number of times) elements already in the set with a certain element not in the set.

So for example the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are a field, and we can create a field extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ which will be the set of all numbers $x + y\sqrt{2}$ where $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$.
