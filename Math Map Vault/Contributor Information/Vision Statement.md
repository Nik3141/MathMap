# Vision Statement

---

The goal of this math map is to provide a self-contained resource which allows anybody, regardless of prior mathematical knowledge, ability, or maturity, to learn any mathematical topic they want.

To this end, the goal is that all of K-12 mathematics would be structured around arithmetic, naive set theory and basic zeroth- and first- order logic.

Although we're using Obsidian for this project, the goal is not to create a web of ideas as is normal in Obsidian. We don't want to recreate Wikipedia, with its plethora of inline links and labyrinthine circular dependencies (it's never fun to visit a Wikipedia page with 20 links in the first sentence, and visiting some of those links takes you to other pages which link back to the page you started at). Wikipedia pages are almost impossible to learn math from because rather than explaining it like you would when teaching, they just present the information. To understand essentially already need to know about what's being presented.

Instead, we want to create a well-curated and straightfoward progression from the very beginnings of mathematics all the way to its extremities. The goal is that a person with no math knowledge can read through it and thereâ€™s nothing implied/left unsaid. That way it can be used by teachers in school classrooms, parents of homeschoolers, and self-learning students; it can be useful to anyone, regardless of where they are in their math education.

In practice, this means that each concept should ideally link to one or two closely related concepts that would be logical to learn next. So as an example, if you've just learned about truth tables, it's reasonable to next learn how to apply them to understand logical operators. That's why truth tables link to the logical operators.

It's tempting to connect a note with every other note that could come after, but try to only connect notes to other very closely related notes in the same topic. This is because we want to structure the map in "sequences" of notes, all on the same topic, which follow each other in a relatively linear fashion. If you know that some note A connects to some other note B in another sequence, just connect the last note in the sequence containing A to the first note in the sequence containing B.
